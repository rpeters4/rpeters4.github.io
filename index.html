<h3>About me
    
<p>I'm a passionate programmer looking to help change the way small, non-tech saavy people see technology through consulting programs that apply system administration and software development to real world problems.</p></h3>

<h3>Professional Interests
    
<p>I enjoy working in many different aspects of software from nachine learning, to web development but I would like to focus mainly on number analytics with large data sets. I'm currently working on looking at NFL statistics from many years ago to apply it to formulas to help me predict who I should pick up for my fantasy football team. It's a project I started in my senior year of college that I've been working on and off for about a year now. Starting in January of 2017, I plan on building more functionality onto it using a self made agile model to help with my development habits. </p></h3>

<h3>Personal Interests
    
<p>I enjoy spending my little free time playing a video game called Final Fantasy 14 Online where I run a Free Company with some friends. </p></h3>
